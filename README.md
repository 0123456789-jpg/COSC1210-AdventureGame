# GooseStone

## Description

This is my final project for COSC 1210 (Computer Science I) Fall 2025.

In this game, you will be a goose, move around, jump through portals, and collect gems. When you collect all kinds of gems, you simply win. Challenge yourself by increasing the number of dimensions or speed up your run time.

## Launch

Simply hit run in `goosestone/main.ipynb`.

## Controls

Click on the map to walk there. Remember your goose will stop if there's a mountain in front of it. If you want to quit, hit `escape` key. Press `s` key anytime to save your progress __(TODO)__.
